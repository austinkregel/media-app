## About Fringe
This project is still under development, but aims to strike a balance between performance and ease of use.

Currently Fringe supports dynamic routing with templating support. It uses Express as it's underlying http engine.

For an ORM style package I've been looking into [bookshelfjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bookshelfjs) but have not had a chance to test it or it's performance.
